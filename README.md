# React Native AsyncStorage Bug: Data Not Immediately Available

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using AsyncStorage in React Native: data isn't immediately accessible after using `setItem`.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in your application.

## Bug Description

The `AsyncStorage.setItem` method is asynchronous.  While it may appear to complete successfully, the data isn't actually written to storage instantaneously.  Any attempts to read this data immediately after calling `setItem` will likely return `null`.

## Solution

The solution is to use the `AsyncStorage.getItem` method within a `then` block of the `setItem` promise, ensuring the data is available before accessing it. Alternatively, consider using a state management solution like Context API or Redux to better handle asynchronous operations and data flow.
